1. Loop through an Array with For-Of
Create an array of your favorite movies. Write a function that uses a for-of loop to print each movie to the console.

2. Enumerates Properties with For-In Loop
Given an object representing a car with properties like make, model and year. Write a function that uses a for-in loop to print each property name ane its value.

3. Basic For Loop Exercise
Write a function that uses a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5(and not 3) print "Buzz". For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Example FizzBuzz function.






4. Practicing Do-While Loop
Create a function that simulates a simple guessing game. This function should generate a random number between 1 and 10 and then prompt the user to guess the number. Use a do-while loop to keep asking them to guess again until they get it right.

Note: Since TypeScript runs on Node.js for this task, consider a pesudo-code or describe the logic, as `prompt` is not available in standard Node.js without additional packages.






5. While Loop For a Countdown
Write a number that takes a number as an argument and counts down to zero using a while loop, printing each number to the console.

Example countdown function






6. Enums For Days of the Week

Example enum for days and function.





7. Tuples For RGB Colors
